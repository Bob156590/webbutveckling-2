                <h3>Titanfall 2</h3>

                <p>The best FPS game i've ever played because you could summon a giant mech to fight with after killing some players. But that doesn't mean that you can't distory the mech beacue if the mech misplays it's easy for a reguler person to take it down.</p>

                <p>This is the game that got me into the "Darksouls" genre aka hard to beat games. And it helps that i'm a weeb and like swords.</p>

                <p>Hollow knight is my favorite 2d game of all time. And the game that got me to like the 2d genre. The reason why i like it is because it's a platformer and is also not an easy game beacuse if you die you leave behind your soul and if you die before getting it back you lose all your money. Which makes the trilling. The art is also butifull. I would recommend you play this game</p>

                <p>In my opinion i think, no i know that this the best is the best Assassins Creed game ever. The reason being that you play as a pirate captain and control your own ship which is already a thousand times better then the other games but this game is also semi open world games which means you can attack who you when you which fun.</p>

                <p>GOD OF WAR is the 8th game in the serise and the reason why i choose this over the other 7 games is because this one is open world which for you none gemers means you can go anywhere in the which gives a lot of freedom to the player which is way i like it.</p>

                <h3>THE LAST OF US</h3>

                <P>This is my favorite game period. The reason being that everything about this game is just perfect from storytelling to music to character to the mood the game sets. No jokes but every nighttime in the game i was literally praying for it to be daytime again because it was so scary. ps this game is a thousand times better then any fallout game and a million time better then the movie "I am legend".</P>
